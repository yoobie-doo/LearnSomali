**Somali Reference Grammar (Second Revised Edition)**

**by John Ibrahim Saeed**

**Dunwoody Press**

This book is truly indispensable for serious students. Many of the Somali textbooks out there have good short explanations of concepts in the Somali language, but Saeed’s *Somali Reference Grammar* contains much greater depth and has helped me learn so much. Whenever I am confused by a concept in one of my other books, I look up the topic in this one and I can usually find an explanation that clarifies it for me. In about 300 pages, Saeed’s work carefully discusses sounds, orthography, verbs, nouns, noun phrases, adjectives, prepositions, simple sentences, subordinate clauses, coordination, adverbials, and time expressions.

*Somali Reference Grammar* can be intimidating for someone who is just starting out learning the language because it appears a bit technical (it is not an introductory guide!), but once you have some working knowledge of Somali and want to really sharpen your understanding, this is the book that will help you do that. As a beginning student, the thing that confused me the most was word order, but the discussions of word order in this book really helped my understanding. Each lesson in Zorc and Issa’s *Somali Textbook* references pages in the first edition of *Somali Reference Grammar* so it works very well to study both of these works side by side. The page numbers in the first and second edition are different, but the second edition includes a concordance linking every page in the first edition to the second so it is easy to find what you are looking for. Highly, highly recommended for anyone pursuing fluency.





**Beginner’s Somali Grammar**

**by Morgan Nilsson**

**University of Gothenburg**

This is just one of the resources in Professor Morgan Nilsson’s excellent *Somali Introduction Courses.* See my review of the entire set of course materials, including this resource, in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnSomali/comments/qspy7e/somali\_online\_andor\_downloadable\_course/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnSomali/comments/qspy7e/somali_online_andor_downloadable_course/)





**Somali Grammar Revision**

**by Liban A. Ahmad**

**AuthorHouse**

*Somali Grammar Revision* is a very concise guide to Somali grammar which one could sit down and read from front to back in an afternoon. Ahmad does not merely replicate the material from works like John Ibrahim Saeed’s *Somali Reference Grammar* but in a shorter form, however. His main achievement with this book is to explain some of the trickiest parts of Somali grammar, exposing diversity and complexity. Ahmad covers odd phrases and constructions that many grammar guides and textbooks do not, which is why this book is indispensable for intermediate learners.

Reading this book is humbling for the beginner or intermediate student who believes they are getting a handle on Somali, only to realize that that language can be a lot messier than most textbooks would lead them to believe. Textbooks tend to present a fairly uniform version of the Somali language to students, which is perfectly justifiable for books aimed at new learners. Besides, the most difficult constructions in Somali tend to be so because they are also the most rare.

Ahmad reassures us that “of the seven grammatical categories discussed in the book, the verb and the adjective--20% of Somali categories--constitute more than 80% of written and spoken Somali because use of tenses affects both grammatical categories.” And that’s the main point. Knowing basic Somali grammar and vocabulary will have you covered for most communication, but it takes understanding some of these more unusual constructions to go from an intermediate level to an advanced level. It is very difficult, but without books like *Somali Grammar Revision*, it would be considerably moreso.





**Learn Somali in Context: Examples from Internet Media**

**by H. Jerome Goforth**

**Independently published**

Goforth’s *Learn Somali in Context* is an excellent intermediate book to help students understand all the nuances of conjunctions and prepositions. It’s an excellent book for intermediate learners, and there’s no other Somali textbook that looks at this area of grammar in such detail. The book itself uses snippets from authentic texts to demonstrate proper usage and context. I would recommend that intermediate Somali students use this work alongside Dunwoody Press’s *Somali Newspaper Reader*, as both books teach with example texts. Using prepositions and conjunctions correctly is the surest way to start sounding like a native speaker, and Goforth has written the best book for anyone trying to master this area.





**The Somali Translator's Companion**

**by Liban A. Ahmad**

**PublishNation**

[https://www.amazon.com/Somali-Translators-Companion-Liban-Ahmad-ebook/dp/B00ICSF8NG/](https://www.amazon.com/Somali-Translators-Companion-Liban-Ahmad-ebook/dp/B00ICSF8NG/)

This is a short Kindle book going over the basics of Somali grammar, with a special focus on common mistakes that translators and others make. At just 33 pages, it's a nice and concise summary to review the main concepts. All of Liban Ahmad's books are very good, so I was happy to discover this one too.





**Somali Syntax**

**by A. K. Zholkovskij**

**Academy of Sciences of the USSR**

*Somali Syntax* is an intense book, not for the faint of heart. It goes deeper on sentence structure than any other resource I’ve seen, but it is probably not necessary for someone to read unless they are studying Somali linguistics at an academic level.





**Hikmad Soomaali**

**By Muuse Haaji Ismaa’iil Galaal and B. W. Andrzejewski**

**Oxford University Press**

This is a very good grammar book, but it was published in 1959 so it does not have the post-1972 standardized spellings. Not recommended until you’ve extensively covered Somali in other resources first.





**Practical Grammar of the Somali Language with a Manual of Sentences**

**by Evangeliste de Larajasse and Cyprien de Sampont**

**Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co., Ltd.**

This one is over 100 years old (well before the time written Somali became more standardized in its current form) so I would strongly recommend starting with any and all of the more current resources first.





**Notes on the Somali language : with examples of phrases and conversational sentences**

**by J. W. C. Kirk**

**Oxford University Press**

This was published in 1903 and does not contain the standard spellings. Instead of this book, start with the resources published anytime after the orthography was standardized in 1972.





**A grammar of the Somali language, with examples in prose and verse and an account of the Yibir and Midgan dialects**

**by J. W. C. Kirk**

**Cambridge University Press**

Again, this book from 1903 won’t be much help to beginners because of its non-standard spellings. Use a book written in or after 1972.
