# Transparent Language

[Transparent Language](https://www.transparent.com/courses#/somali?vis=individual&amp;hash=individuals) is a website and app with a language learning program similar to Duolingo– but it has Somali! I hadn’t heard of it until I saw it listed as one of PC Mag’s “[Best Language Learning Apps for 2024](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-language-learning-software)” where contributor Jill Duffy rated it the “Best for Hard-to-Find Languages.” *Transparent Language* probably has more content for some languages than others, and the Somali content is all at a beginner level. Most beginners I see on this subreddit are looking for a site/app like this where there are structured lessons with word and phrase flashcards pre-made and ready to go with full audio for pronunciation. There is no intermediate or advanced content, and the grammar instruction appears to be minimal as far as I can tell. But if you are a beginner in Somali, it’s definitely worth checking out. Every Somali learner will still need to use textbooks and other resources to understand all of the different ways to say certain phrases in Somali.

Once logged in, you’ll see four tabs in the upper left part of the screen that read “Learning,” “Browse,” “My Transcript,” and “Resources.” The main page is under the “Learning” tab. That’s where you’ll set up your lesson plan, or “learning path”. To add lessons, go to “Browse” and click on the “+” icon on the right of the lessons you want to add to your “learning path.” Then return to “Learning” and begin your lessons at any pace and in any order you choose. You can delete and change your learning path any time based on what you want to work on. I haven’t looked through all the lessons but from what I’ve seen the grammar looks decent and the pronunciation is correct. The “Somali Alphabet Course” is one hour, the “Somali Essentials” lessons comprise 15 hours, and “Somali General Vocabulary” comprises 78 hours of content.

I should also say that while I only looked at the Somali learning content for English speakers, *Transparent Language* also offers Somali lessons for Turkish and Spanish speakers.

*Transparent Language* offers a free 14-day trial, and then after that it looks like it’s $24.95 a month for individuals. Membership on the site grants access to lessons for all 100 languages available-- not just Somali. It’s free at some public libraries, and you can search here to see if a library in your area offers free access. You’d have to go to the library in person to use it, so bring headphones I guess.

If you’re a beginner, definitely [check it out](https://www.transparent.com/courses#/somali?vis=individual&amp;hash=individuals)!

  


# Somali Introduction Courses

# by Morgan Nilsson

# University of Gothenburg

Morgan Nilsson is a professor of Somali who has done incredible work adapting older Somali textbooks and updating them with the standard orthography so that Swedish- and English-speaking students can use them today. His course materials from the University of Gothenburg include a textbook series, a grammar guide, audio files, a reader series, a wordlist, and readings on the history of the Somali language. God bless this man for creating some of the best Somali language resources in the last 25 years. Many are still a work in progress, so check on his web pages periodically for new and updated material.

Overview of the program, and links to resource pages.

**Beginner’s Somali Workbook**

**by Morgan Nilsson**

**University of Gothenburg**

[https://morgannilsson.se/](https://morgannilsson.se/)

I read *Beginner’s Somali Workbook* when Nilsson had only finished lessons 1 through 19 for Somali level 1 and 2 courses, so while I wish this textbook went farther in a few areas, it was still a work in progress at that point. Nilsson is still improving on these, and has more textbooks in the works, which will likely become available as he teaches the higher level Somali courses at his university. Nilsson’s *Beginner’s Somali Workbook* is an update of a 1950’s textbook to include the standard post-1972 spellings of Somali words. Its explanations of concepts (in both English and in Swedish, side by side) are very good but for right now this textbook isn’t complete with discussion of more complicated concepts, like using the optative case and conjugating irregular verbs. In the completed sections of the textbook, it does not include very many example phrases to help students practice concepts and make flashcards. In that way, Nilsson’s *BSW* is more similar to Orwin’s *Colloquial Somali* than it is to Zorc and Issa’s *Somali Textbook*. Still, it's all a work in progress. Volumes 1 and 2 are out now, with volumes 3 and 4 on the way.

*BSW* is a high-quality resource by a top scholar that comes at an unbeatable price, but I’d recommend pairing this course book with another resource that will help you build a bank of flashcards. Gleeson et al.’s *A Somali Language Learning Manual* is what I’d recommend to fill that gap if you are coming to Nilsson’s course as an absolute beginner. Also, the African Languages Department at the University of Gothenburg has a Quizlet page, which has some pre-made English/Somali flashcards corresponding the lessons in this book: [https://quizlet.com/AfrLangGothenburg](https://quizlet.com/AfrLangGothenburg)

**Beginner’s Somali Grammar**

**by Morgan Nilsson**

**University of Gothenburg**

[https://morgannilsson.se/](https://morgannilsson.se/)

Morgan Nilsson’s *Beginner’s Somali Grammar* works well alongside *Beginner’s Somali Workbook* and the explanations are clear and typically detailed. It is hard to find high quality grammar resources of this length, so I was excited that Nilsson had a book like this. I still think that John Ibrahim Saeed’s *Somali Reference Grammar* is the best and most detailed book of this type that I’ve seen, but with tricky grammar subjects it’s great to have multiple reliable resources.

**Beginner’s Somali Reader**

**by Morgan Nilsson**

**University of Gothenburg**

[https://morgannilsson.se/](https://morgannilsson.se/)

Morgan Nilsson has curated basic material from old Somali K12 textbooks that is suitable for helping beginners learn Somali, and he presents it here alongside the dialogues for his course. The reading material is divided by each lesson, corresponding with *Beginner’s Somali Reader*. I am pretty sure most of the textbooks he is pulling from are in the collection that Jibril Aw Mohamed compiled at The Ohio State University.

In my opinion, the best feature of Nilsson’s entire course is the dialogues in this book. They are made of nice repetitive conversational phrases starting with the most simple in the first chapter, and growing a bit more complex as the chapters go on. Nilsson includes audio for these on his website.

**Taking Somali Online at the University of Gothenburg**

[https://www.universityadmissions.se/intl/search](https://www.universityadmissions.se/intl/search)

If you want to apply for the online courses, use this link and search for “Somali” and which term you want to take it. I’m not 100% sure how it works since I haven’t done it, but it looks like every class is offered during every term. It’s not essential to take the courses if you are using and learning from the course materials in your own way, but for people who want the structure of a traditional course, this is probably the best way to get it.

Keep an eye on the University of Gothenburg’s future Somali course offerings, if this is a way you enjoy learning. Nilsson teases future exciting courses in the years ahead.

*“We are also making preliminary plans for S****O1211, Somali Text Reading and Translation 1 (7.5 ects)****, building on Somali 4 (SO1205), hopefully offered in the autumn term of 2022.* ***SO1221, Somali Grammar and Linguistics 1 (7.5 ects)****, building on Somali 4 (SO1205), hopefully offered in the spring term of 2023.* ***SO1106, Somali Oral and Written Proficiency 1 (7.5 ects)****, building on Somali 1 (SO1102).* ***SO1206, Somali Oral and Written Proficiency 2 (7.5 ects)****, building on Somali 2 (SO1203) + Proficiency 1 (SO1106).”*

**Somali Language and Linguistics: A Bibliography**

**By Morgan Nilsson**

**University of Gothenburg**

[https://morgannilsson.se/](https://morgannilsson.se/)

This is a massive bibliography of seemingly every book, article, and resource written about the Somali language by European scholars, from the 19th century to the present. It’s really an amazing achievement by Nilsson putting all of this together, and what a boon for students. There are a lot of great English-Somali resources I might never have discovered myself if not for this 174 page document.

  


# Somali Level 1 &amp; 2

# by Moses McCormick

# The FLR Method

Moses McCormick was a self-taught polyglot who created a business selling courses designed around the technique that he used to become conversant in so many languages. He was neither a native Somali speaker nor a Somali specialist, but he was quite accomplished with Somali and with foreign languages in general. For proof of that, he uploaded many videos on his YouTube channel showing off his speaking abilities in Somali and other languages with random native speakers he approaches and talks to in stores and around town. His FLR (“Foreign Language Roadrunning”) approach is extremely light on grammar, as this course is intended mostly as a way for students to quickly learn and work with the most common everyday phrases they will encounter when they meet Somali speakers so that they can build good conversation skills before diving into grammar.

I did things the opposite way and spent several months studying grammar before doing this course. There’s not really one right or wrong way--do whatever makes the most sense for you and what keeps you motivated to continue learning. McCormick takes learning grammar seriously, but just takes a unique approach to beginning to learn a language. Having studied many languages himself, McCormick believed that the best and fastest way to get good at a language is to learn how to ask and respond to the most common questions you’ll get from Somali speakers (“Who taught you Somali?” “Who is your teacher?” What is your reason for learning Somali?”) along with keywords to help you form your own phrases. You’ll learn those in the early modules of the course. Then the later modules of the course help you introduce yourself, your background, and your interests to Somali speakers. Each week of the course contains a relatively small number of phrases to learn, but they are really important phrases to commit to memory through listening to the audio over and over, and by experimenting with the phrases using the keywords. Watch his videos (linked below) that explain how to use this unique language course.

When you buy both modules of McCormick’s Somali course for $80, you get text files and mp3 files to go along with the texts. All of the audio files in his Somali course were recorded by native speakers. The keys to success in this course are repetition, experimentation, and practicing with native speakers. With that in mind, I would listen to each question and reply ten times on a loop, with the text on the screen for reference. I listened over and over again, sometimes intently and sometimes in the background while taking care of my daily work. This is a really great way to study, and it helps to burn the common phrases in your mind. And if you already know the grammar pretty well, having these example phrases at the forefront of your mind really helps to retain concepts. I made flashcards for each lesson too.

Studying the lessons in McCormick’s FLR course really helped me get comfortable using longer sentences in my Somali speaking and writing. Practicing these phrases gave me a much better sense of how to string together more complicated thoughts from the short, clipped phrases I knew from studying my grammar book. His system of slowly introducing keywords (mostly conjunctions, interjections, and transition words) in weeks 1-7 of the course is so intuitive and helpful that it seems like such an obviously good way to learn a language, but surprisingly no other Somali resource teaches the material in this way. It also helped me learn how to make my Somali phrases sound smoother and more conversational, and less like they came straight out of a textbook. I would say that McCormick’s Somali Level 1 course is better and more essential than Level 2. In Level 1, the question-answer and keyword structure is quite unique and helpful, but in Level 2, every lesson is basically a recorded dialogue, of the type you’d find in many other resources.

I highly recommend buying at least Level 1 of McCormick’s course because there’s really nothing else like it. It does not teach you everything you need as a beginner (for that you’ll need a textbook) but it is an exceptionally helpful course for getting good at conversational Somali. It would have taken me so much longer to get confident in conversations if this course did not exist. Whether you want to do what I did and study a lot of grammar first, or start using McCormick’s course as a first resource, I would recommend the FLR method to every beginning student of Somali.

# Somali - 200 Hour Course

# U.S. Army Special Forces

# Language Visual Training Materials

You have to understand that the US Army’s 200 hour course on Somali is designed for soldiers who have a few weeks to get up to speed on the language before going to Somalia, and who probably don’t care about getting the grammar perfectly right. This course is good for someone who needs a fast crash course before traveling to Somalia. However, the grammar modeled in the course is too crude, and the translations are too imprecise, for someone who is really pursuing fluency over the long term. Even as a beginner, I looked at some of the example sentences in here thinking, “This doesn’t sound quite right.” If you already have some knowledge of Somali from using other resources, I think it can be very helpful to use the audio and the e-book in this course. For just $10, it’s definitely worth checking out. But read/listen with some caution. I would never recommend this course as a starting point for an absolute beginner unless they told me they were 4-6 weeks away from traveling to Somali and didn’t care how their grammar sounded because they just needed to get around.

The Kindle e-book version of this course costs $10, and you don’t need to have a Kindle to get it. You can go on Amazon’s web page for this e-book and download “Kindle for PC” or “Kindle for Mac”, and then once Amazon sees it has a place to send you the Kindle book, it will let you buy it. Then once you open the Kindle book on your PC or Mac, you’ll see that it has all of the pages of the written course materials. Go to the very last page in the Kindle book, and there is a link with the audio files. The first thing you’ll notice about these audio files is that most of them are just about three seconds long and only have a few words each, which is annoying unless your computer can put them on some kind of autoplay.

If you’re an absolute beginner who needs a crash course before going to Somalia in a couple months, then this is the course for you. If you’re new to the language, interested in becoming fluent, and have more time to learn the concepts and nuances of the language, then I’d start somewhere else. Particularly in the later lessons, the highly questionable syntax of the longer Somali example phrases, and the slapdash English translations make this a pretty frustrating resource for the serious student. This course is a fine resource to use after you already have some background so you can spot the errors and correct them yourself, but it should tell you a lot that even a beginner can spot the poor rendering of so many Somali phrases. Every book and course on Somali or any language inevitably has some mistakes and typos, but in the Army’s 200 hour course it’s definitely more than usual. Take this course for what it’s worth, and read it with a highly critical eye.
