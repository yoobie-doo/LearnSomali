**Somali-English Dictionary with English Index**

**by R. David Zorc and Madina M. Osman**

**Dunwoody Press**

The dictionary from Dunwoody Press is tremendously useful, and it's probably the most detailed and comprehensive dictionary of its kind that’s easily accessible on the market. Many other dictionaries provide just the bare minimum in their entries: a word and its equivalent in the other language. Zorc and Osman’s dictionary is replete with information. Each entry in the Somali-English side provides root forms of the word, definite/indefinite conjugations and gender (for nouns), alternate conjugations (if any), multiple translations, and usually includes helpful synonyms or example sentences. Its English-Somali side is less detailed, though a user can find the basic translation of the word they need in the English-Somali side, and then look up the translation in the Somali-English side for more information. There are 26,000 entries overall.

As with anything, if you want quality then you have to pay for it. This dictionary will cost you $125, which is really the only downside to purchasing it. If you’re serious about pursuing fluency, I would highly recommend getting this dictionary. A high-quality dictionary is an absolute must if you want to make progress. Google Translate is no substitute. If you don’t have that much cash on hand right now, the *Concise Somali-English English-Somali Dictionary* from Hagar is a good dictionary of comparable scope to this one for 1/5 of the price. But it contains far less information and is not as useful for learning how to use new words. (See my review down below.) What I decided to do was to buy both, and to use the Hagar dictionary when I am on the go while keeping the Dunwoody dictionary at home for when I am studying there.





**Advanced English-Somali Dictionary**

**by Ahmed Hussein Mire**

It is not an exaggeration to say that Ahmed Hussein Mire’s *Advanced English-Somali Dictionary* is one of the most extraordinary reference works I have ever seen. This volume is a monumental achievement by Mire, and an answer to the prayers of students and scholars alike. It seems to be intended for Somali speakers who are learning English, but it’s also an outstanding resource for English speakers studying Somali.

The entire dictionary is 1205 pages long, and contains nearly 150,000 entries. The entries are English words, followed by definitions in Somali. Mire is incredibly comprehensive, and provides Somali definitions for every possible sense a certain word carries in English. This sets *Advanced English-Somali Dictionary* apart from so many other dictionary, which give you a word or two in the other language but don’t really demonstrate how to use that word. It’s amazing to just page through this dictionary and see the scope of the work. The level of detail, the precision in separating out the different possible meanings of the English words, and the generosity of its Somali renderings set the Mire’s dictionary in a league by itself. It’s far and away the best English-Somali dictionary that exists. Since it does not include a Somali-English component for looking up Somali words, I would recommend pairing this dictionary with the best Somali-English dictionary in existence, which I believe is Zorc and Osman’s *Somali-English Dictionary with English Index* from Dunwoody Press.

Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to get a copy of Mire’s dictionary. Finding one for sale online is challenging, and when one does come up for sale online it can be outrageously expensive. I was lucky enough to find mine from an online retailer, and it cost me $200 plus shipping. I considered that a pretty good deal since I’ve seen other copies come up for sale for $1000. I’ve seen user reviews of this dictionary on Amazon and elsewhere saying that it’s possible to get copies of *Advanced English-Somali Dictionary* for $40 if you can find one of the right Somali bookstores. If you live in a city with large numbers of Somali people, a Somali bookstore in your area may be able to help you. I’d also recommend looking for this book on the website for Looh Press (based in the UK) when their website is back up and running, if it ever comes back. [https://www.loohpress.com/](https://www.loohpress.com/)

The Amazon reviewers who got Mire’s dictionary for $40 wrote that a copy of this book would be worth buying even at $400, and I agree. That is probably the maximum amount I would be willing to pay to get a copy if I did not have one. *Advanced English-Somali Dictionary* is one of the best resources ever created for students of either language to learn the other. It’s like the Rosetta Stone. Don’t worry about trying to get a copy of this dictionary when you are just starting out. It’s really not meant for beginners, and it won’t be much help until you’ve learned at least a couple thousand Somali words. But I would recommend that in the beginning of your studies, you occasionally take time to see how you might be able to access a copy. Maybe there’s a Somali bookstore in your area. Maybe a university library in your area has a copy. Maybe a language student in your network has a copy. And maybe a copy will pop up for sale on eBay or some other website. As a beginner, don’t obsess over finding a copy, and don’t give in to the price-gougers--but do keep your eyes open.





**Qaamuuska Af-Soomaaliga**

**by Annarita Puglielli &amp; Cabdalla Cumar Mansuur**

**Roma Tre University, Center of Somali Studies**

This is a remarkable 970 page dictionary. It is entirely in Somali, however. All of the entries are in Somali, and all of the definitions are in Somali. This isn’t going to be any help for beginners, but it’s a great resource to keep in mind when you get to an advanced level.





**Aasaasi Essential English Somali Dictionary - Second Edition**

**Fiqi Publishers**

I decided not to get this one because I was able to get copies of *Advanced English-Somali Dictionary* and the Dunwoody Press dictionary. If you are unable to get copies of those, this dictionary is an option. R. David Zorc, co-author of Dunwoody Press’s *Somali Textbook,* recommended this dictionary in an old PDF I found. From the ad copy: “Contains 50,000 entries - the most frequently used words and phrases encountered by intermediate and advanced learners of English. Abundant illustrations. Common word combinations show how words and phrases are used together.”





**Fiqi's Somali-English Dictionary**

**by Awil Ali Hashi &amp; Abdirahman A. Hashi**

**Fiqi Publishers**

This is another dictionary recommended by the great R. David Zorc. I haven’t gotten it because I have the Dunwoody Press dictionary, but if you can’t get that one, this one also sounds promising. A reviewer said of *Fiqi’s Somali-English Dictionary* that it is “the best Somali-English dictionary (other than Dunwoody’s) and it contains over 20,000 Somali words with English translations and English pronunciations with Somali phonetics.”





**English - Somali Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus / Qaamuus iyo ‘Tesooras’ Ingiriisi - Soomaali Advanced Level**

**HAAN Associates**

HAAN Associates published their English-Somali dictionary and Somali-English thesaurus together in a single volume, but you can also buy the HAAN dictionary separately. The dictionary has English-language entries with the definitions written in Somali, while the very rudimentary “thesaurus” lists Somali words and with synonyms in English. To the English-speaking student of Somali, this book functions as a decent dictionary, albeit with clear limitations. The most severe issue is that none of the noun entries include grammatical gender. In a language like Somali where every noun corresponds to a grammatical gender (either male or female), any dictionary that doesn’t include a noun’s gender is always going to be third rate. It’s almost impossible to use nouns correctly in everyday Somali sentences if you haven’t memorized their genders. I’d recommend getting the cheaper, newer, and easier-to-find *Concise Somali-English English-Somali Dictionary* from Hagar instead of this one.





**Somali Learner's Dictionary / Qaamuuska Barashada Ingiriis-Soomaali**

**HAAN Associates**

This is a simpler version of HAAN Associates’ more comprehensive English-Somali dictionary, and this one is easier for beginning students to work with. It has English word entries with Somali definitions. It’s a nice resource, but it’s super annoying that (like the other HAAN dictionary) the Somali entries for nouns do not give the grammatical gender.





**Concise Somali-English English-Somali Dictionary**

**Hagar Dictionaries**

For being priced in the $25 range, this is a good value for a basic dictionary. Its word entries are nowhere near as detailed and helpful as the entries Zorc and Osman wrote for the Dunwoody Press dictionary, but it has basic translations of 17,000 words. A typical entry tells you the part of speech, and then one translation of the word in the other language. Its major weakness is that it does not even provide the grammatical gender of the nouns to be able to convert them from indefinite (“an X”) to definite (“the X”). Grammatical gender is also the basis for all sorts of noun and verb conjugations when using nouns in sentences. It’s not something you can just ignore or guess. For those reasons, I never use this dictionary if I have my Dunwoody Press dictionary at hand. Still, as I wrote in my review of the Dunwoody Press dictionary, I recommend buying both of these so that you can have a backup dictionary on the go and keep your best dictionary safe at home.





**Qaamuuska Sarbeebta Ingiriisi - Soomaali, Urutina iyo Tarjumaadda (English - Somali Dictionary of Idioms, Compilation and Translation)**

**by Yusuf Kahin**

**Scansom Publishers**

Kahin’s idiom dictionary is intended for Somali speakers who are learning English. It is a collection of English language idioms with explanations of their meanings written in Somali. Each entry also includes an English-language example sentence. I bought this book hoping that it was a dictionary of Somali-language idioms, and while it’s not that, the Somali explanations in here are still quite valuable. Since most idioms correspond to common expressions and situations, the Somali explanations in here offer many helpful suggestions for rendering these common thoughts in Somali so that the meaning survives the translation. This book isn’t necessary for beginners. Think of it as a useful supplement to Ahmed Hussein Mire’s *Advanced English-Somali Dictionary*.





**English - Somali Legal Dictionary: Based on the United States Legal System**

**by Abdul Guled Elmi**

**Self published?**

This book consists of English-language legal terms with paragraph-long definitions and explanations written in Somali. The jacket copy tells us the author “Mr. Elmi became the first court certified Somali interpreter in Minnesota and that nation in 2009.” He is a highly accomplished translator who has been working for more than 25 years, and his legal dictionary is a very important resource. This book isn’t relevant for everyone, but if your work requires working knowledge of the law in both languages, then here’s your guide. You will probably find it helpful to use this dictionary side by side with an English-language legal dictionary and/or with *The Somali Court Interpreter* by Adam O’Hirsi which is more concise but includes English definitions of the legal terms as well.





**The Somali Court Interpreter**

**by Adam O’Hirsi**

**AuthorHouse**

*The Somali Court Interpreter* doesn’t have the word “dictionary” in its title, but that’s what it is. The main difference between *English - Somali Legal Dictionary* by Elmi and *The Somali Court Interpreter* by O’Hirsi is that O’Hirsi provides all of the definitions and explanations in both languages side by side. This is helpful for ensuring strong understanding of each legal concept, and for seeing the particular way that O’Hirsi makes his translations. The explanations here are much less detailed than they are in Elmi’s legal dictionary, but this is a book that’s much more accessible to students whose work requires them to express and understand legal terms in both languages. I recommend using both books side by side if the topic of law is relevant to you and your field.





**Somali Glossary for Public Service Interpreters: English -&gt; Somali**

**by Helena El Masri, Mike Muraseh Osman, and Omar Osman**

**DPSI Law and Health Options**

[https://dpsionline.co.uk/glossary-and-resources/](https://dpsionline.co.uk/glossary-and-resources/)

This 164 page legal glossary costs about $20 for the PDF form and it’s one of the best resources for legal terms in Somali. The largest sections of *Somali Glossary for Public Service Interpreters* cover general legal vocabulary and highly detailed health/ailment vocabulary. I’d say that if you are interested in medical vocabulary and find yourself unable to locate any of the Somali medical dictionaries listed below, this legal glossary is your best option since the medical section is quite substantial, sitting around 50 pages. *Somali Glossary for Public Service Interpreters* also has appendices covering vocabulary pertinent to police and government ministries, housing law, business law, and technology law. This isn’t just a resource for lawyers and court interpreters, however. We all use so many words in English every day that we may not perceive as legal or business jargon, but have their origins in law. Translating those words correctly in Somali is really only possible with resources like this, since many of the general dictionaries simply do not offer such precision.





**Medical Dictionary English-Somali &amp; Somali-English**

**by Anwar M. Diiriye**

[https://www.loohpress.com/](https://www.loohpress.com/)

Very hard to find. Looh Press in the UK still had a few copies as of late 2020. If you are in the UK, check it out. Otherwise, everyone else will have to wait until Looh Press resurrects their website, which has been down for nearly a year as I write this.





**Concise Somali Medical Dictionary (Qaamuus Caafimaad Qeexan Soomaali)**

**by Liban Ali Diriye**

It exists, but good luck finding a copy.





**Qaamuuska Caafimaadka (Medical Dictionary)**

**by Mohamad Ali Hassan**

**Scansom Publishers**

This is the only Somali medical dictionary I’ve been able to get my hands on. *Qaamuuska Caafimaadka* is terrific, and Hassan did a wonderful job compiling the material. It has 118 pages plus a brief appendix, and the entire dictionary is made up of Somali word entries with an English word or two offered as a translation. The dictionary does not have a English-&gt;Somali portion, which means that this resource is best for someone interested in having broad knowledge of medical vocabulary, and intends to go word for word and learn everything in this lean dictionary. If you are only casually interested in medical terms, and need a resource to look up a translation here and there, you’re better off relying on a comprehensive general dictionary with both Somali-&gt;English and English-&gt;Somali sections. Also, quite helpfully, *Qaamuuska Caafimaadka* includes the grammatical gender for every Somali noun it lists. Way too many of these smaller dictionaries leave that critical information out, so it’s nice to see it included here.

	- I'll always post links when I can, but I don't put up links to copyrighted material that non-copyright holders are making available online for free. If copyright-holders themselves are offering their material for free, or if a resource has entered the public domain, then that's different. There's the legal matter, but in addition to that I feel pretty strongly that the scholars and experts who create English-Somali learning resources ought to be able to make a decent living doing it. The English-Somali learning literature is limited enough as it is, and we are all so fortunate to be able to benefit from the work put in by generations of scholars who spent much of their lives creating this material. And credit is due also to the (typically small) publishers who are willing to underwrite their projects. All of those people made our learning possible, and they deserve to be supported so that the English-Somali literature can continue to grow. Some of the resources I recommended in my "Somali Grammar Guides" post are so old that they've entered the public domain, but I did not link to them in that post. Why? Because the Somali language only became standardized to the Latin alphabet in 1972, so any resources created before that time have pretty loose spelling conventions that don't always resemble the post-1972 spellings we are used to seeing. Yes, people still spell things in slightly different ways today, but the spellings in these old resources can be pretty far off. That's why I don't recommend that beginners start with those resources. In fact, I think the body of post-1972 literature is rich enough that they can ignore the pre-1972 resources altogether.Right now, I'm mostly reviewing and recommending book resources, but I will get to online resources in the coming weeks. Those posts will have more links. I'm going more or less in order of importance, since the Somali-English book resources tend to be a lot better and a lot deeper than most web resources.The last thing I would say--just specifically about dictionaries--is that I think it's generally a lot more helpful to have a dictionary in book form than an online or PDF form. PDFs are nice for some things, but with dictionaries it's way better when you can flip through it. ⏤ by *ereyada* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
