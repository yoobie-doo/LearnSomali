# Web Resources

&amp;#x200B;

**The Google Translate Chrome Browser Extension**

I recommend that you download Google Chrome, and add the Google Translate extension. It can automatically translate words and phrases that you highlight as you browse the internet, which is so much nicer than running for a dictionary every time there’s an unfamiliar word in a Somali news article. It can also translate entire websites, so you can read Somali websites in English or your favorite English sites in Somali. Google Translate does not generate a perfect translation of course, but when used correctly it is an incredible tool.

&amp;#x200B;

**MyMemory Translation**

[https://mymemory.translated.net/](https://mymemory.translated.net/)

This is an extremely helpful and cool resource-- both a dictionary and a database of translated phrases. It’s super useful to type in a new Somali word or short phrase and MyMemory can pull up a dozen or so examples of that word or phrase in real sentences.

&amp;#x200B;

**Forvo**

[https://forvo.com/languages/so/](https://forvo.com/languages/so/)

A very limited but useful online pronunciation dictionary for beginners (227 words)

&amp;#x200B;

**uTalk**

[https://utalk.com/en/store/somali](https://utalk.com/en/store/somali)

This is a Duolingo-like vocabulary and common phrases app – subscription required. Haven’t used it myself. I prefer to make my own flashcards, and by the time I discovered this app I already knew a lot of the very basic Somali vocab.

&amp;#x200B;

**Defense Language Institute**

[https://fieldsupport.dliflc.edu/products/somali/sm\_bc\_LSK/default.html](https://fieldsupport.dliflc.edu/products/somali/sm_bc_LSK/default.html)

Common phrases with accompanying pronunciation. Very basic but worthwhile

&amp;#x200B;

**Defense Language Institute GLOSS (Global Language Online Support System)**

[https://gloss.dliflc.edu/Default.aspx](https://gloss.dliflc.edu/Default.aspx)

I’ll have to check it out more, but looks like Somali news articles and quizzes for comprehension

&amp;#x200B;

**Omniglot**

[https://omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm](https://omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm)

Some brief background on the history of the language, with a few links to other resources.

&amp;#x200B;

**“Learn Soomaali Through English” on Udemy**

[https://www.udemy.com/course/somali-language/](https://www.udemy.com/course/somali-language/)

For $12 plus tax, you get about an hour and a half of video going Somali pronunciation, with some phrases tacked on at the end. The majority of the video covers the alphabet and pronunciation, and only the last 11 minutes include dialogues. I would only recommend this to an absolute beginner, who does not know any Somali people and has rarely heard the Somali language spoken. All of the vocabulary and common phrases are ones you could find for free on other websites, so there’s not much here for you unless you’re the person I just described.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Vector Culture patreon page**

[https://www.patreon.com/vectorconsultancy](https://www.patreon.com/vectorconsultancy)

The Somali translators creating these materials have released a lot of videos and quizzes on the basics of Somali grammar and conjugation. However, each video is quite short-- usually around a minute or less. I hope they continue adding content because they clearly have a talented team, but right now the content doesn’t go beyond the most elementary concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sam of Somalia on YouTube**

[https://www.youtube.com/c/SamOfSomaliaTV/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SamOfSomaliaTV/videos)

Sam Burr’s YouTube channel has some good videos that may be useful for Somali learners, as he is a student of Somali himself. Burr is not an expert on the language, but he is an expert on what it’s like trying to learn it. His video on how to start learning Somali is full of great advice for beginners, and it helped me tremendously when I was starting out.

&amp;#x200B;

**SomaliNet Online Library**

[https://www.somalinet.com/library/](https://www.somalinet.com/library/)

An archive of content and links-- some useful and some not.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Qur’an in Somali**

[https://quranenc.com/en/browse/somali\_abduh](https://quranenc.com/en/browse/somali_abduh)

After you select a Surah, there are places on the page you can click “Show other translations” to have the page show English translations and explanations of the Qur’an next to the Somali text.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bible in Somali**

[https://www2.bible.com/bible/87/GEN.1.SOMB?parallel=2016](https://www2.bible.com/bible/87/GEN.1.SOMB?parallel=2016)

Exactly what it sounds like. It’s the Bible in Somali and English, side by side and with Somali audio.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Somali**

[http://unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr\_som.html](http://unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr_som.html)

For our secular friends. Use with the English translation here:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Poetry Translation Centre**

[https://www.poetrytranslation.org/poems/in/somali](https://www.poetrytranslation.org/poems/in/somali)

This is a great website with a few dozen Somali poems and their translations in English.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bogga Hore**

[https://so.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogga\_Hore](https://so.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogga_Hore)

An online encyclopedia on the Wikipedia platform, but all in the Somali language. This isn’t English Wikipedia run through Google Translate-- it’s been written in authentic Somali by Somali speakers. While it does have many articles, it is unsurprisingly not as comprehensive as the English language Wikipedia since there are many more English speakers than Somali speakers in the world. Most articles are short and the editorial standards appear quite lax.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hoyga Suugaanta ee Doollo**

[http://www.doollo.com/index.htm](http://www.doollo.com/index.htm)

“The Largest Online Collection of Somali Poetry”

&amp;#x200B;

**Noradin Schools on YouTube**

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPWv9S6rXNNIrZ1cRt26CKw/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPWv9S6rXNNIrZ1cRt26CKw/playlists)

This channel has hundreds of videos of teachers speaking Somali and giving lessons meant for Somali-speaking children from kindergarten through eighth grade. All of the videos are in Somali, not in English, so this channel isn’t for an absolute beginner. But once you’ve made progress with Somali, watching some of the videos on here (especially the ones meant for small children) can be a fun and helpful way to hear the Somali language as it’s really spoken.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Somali Literacy Project**

[https://thesomaliliteracyproject.com/](https://thesomaliliteracyproject.com/)

This is an excellent and in-depth website for parents who are educating their children in the Somali language. It includes children’s book reviews and discussions on important topics such as navigating the school system, learning with disabilities, and best practices for promoting literacy. It has many links to many more resources for teaching children Somali

&amp;#x200B;

**Medline Plus**

[https://medlineplus.gov/languages/somali.html](https://medlineplus.gov/languages/somali.html)

Medline has a wide-ranging collection of Somali language medical PDFs

# English Videos with Somali Subtitles

If you go on YouTube, most videos have the option to generate subtitles and auto-translate them into any language via Google Translate. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZz03myFuWA) explains how to do it. The translations aren't perfect, but they're pretty darn good if you are watching something where people in the video are speaking clear English without a lot of noise or music in the background. I wish this feature worked better for videos with Somali audio.

Also, a lot of religious media is translated into multiple languages. This [movie adaptation of the Christian gospels](https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jesus.html/english.html) has audio and subtitle options for hundreds of languages, including Somali.

&amp;#x200B;

**Somali React - English Subtitles**

[https://www.youtube.com/c/SomaliReact/featured](https://www.youtube.com/c/SomaliReact/featured)

I’m blown away by this channel. Most of the videos have English subtitles, and there are so many videos modeling conversations in common situations. The stories are engaging, and the production values are high. I count *Somali React* as one of the best resources I’ve ever found.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjusB80NWdo3p4hjc8NVn2w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjusB80NWdo3p4hjc8NVn2w)

Wonderful channel of videos from Somali film students. Not all videos have English subtitles, but some of them do. Eastleighwood seems like a great organization dedicated to youth creativity and women’s empowerment, and the students are just delightful. See, for instance:

- Also,***Arday***, **season 1 - English subtitles**[Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zslx-DOLU_k)[Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSocyZsXNik)[Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX7I6mH2Frs)[Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmiBVXWWUq0)[Episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwpATPge44Y)[Episode 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYEwt7F4wSA)[Episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4lm_gvWSpA)[Episode 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhe--1XoYQc)[Episodes 9 and 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGn9tfnzGho)*Arday*, meaning "student", is the best Somali series I have ever seen, and it's an extraordinary piece of art as much as it is a helpful tool for learning the language and culture. We are so fortunate as students ourselves that this amazing series has English subtitles and that all of season 1 is free on YouTube. As a show, *Arday* could definitely improve in a some important areas. The early episodes introduce characters and situations that the later episodes don't follow up on, and they often have scenes back-to-back that don't fit together tonally. This is less of a problem later on, since episode 4 kicks off the main storyline and the series is a lot more cohesive after that. But you know what? I don't really care about the series' flaws. *Arday* is an extraordinary breakthrough in current Somali media. The storylines, the mature subject matters, the characters, the production design, the direction, the lighting, the locations, and the actresses and actors are excellent. This is my favorite show of the year. There's nothing else like it, as far as I can tell. It's such a breakthrough that as a viewer it's easy to overlook the other issues because of how innovative and impressive the series' other aspects are. Outstanding job to everyone involved. I wish Shukri Abdikadir had more scenes as Zeynab this season since she gives an amazing performance and portrays the most interesting character. Hopefully we will see more of her in season 2. I assume based on the ending that Bile TV will make a second season. We really need to see what happens to these characters. And of course, have more subtitled media to help learn the language. ⏤ by *ereyada* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

		- Hi Mahmud, I appreciate the suggestion but I am hesitant. *Arday*'s loudest critics are conservative imams who object to the taboo topics covered in the series and accuse the series of being a plot from the west to corrupt Somali culture. Those accusations are ridiculous on top of being untrue, but as a white westerner myself I don't know if I'm the right person to start a discussion of the series in r/Somalia because it's harder for me to deflect those critics. And frankly, I'm not interested in arguing with people about the show's content. I just really enjoyed it for its story, production values, and its value as a study resource. I feel comfortable discussing and recommending it in r/LearnSomali since we're just focused on language learning here.(Sorry, my Somali isn't yet at the level where I can express this nuance in that language.) ⏤ by *ereyada* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

- This chapter encompasses the study's background, problem statement, general and specific objectives, research questions, scope, and significance. The doctrine of the separation of powers divides government institutions into three branches: legislative, executive, and judiciary. Each branch operates independently: the legislative makes laws, the executive enforces them, and the judiciary interprets them. This division prevents any single entity from having absolute authority, thus preserving individual liberty and preventing tyranny. The essence of this doctrine is constitutionalism, ensuring a balanced distribution of governmental power. ⏤ by *Noura_Hassan1234* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
