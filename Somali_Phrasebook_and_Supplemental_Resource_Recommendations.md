**Somali Common Expressions**

**by Abdullahi A. Issa**

**Dunwoody Press**

Abdullahi Issa’s *Somali Common Expressions* is an expensive but ultimately very worthwhile phrasebook. It includes 600 common phrases organized by topic, and it has excellent examples of the many different forms Somali sentences can take. It is a fairly slim book, but it includes 3 CDs that have audio of male and female native speakers reading each Somali phrase. Qasim Farah’s *Teach Yourself Somali* is the only other book of common expressions that has audio tracks for every phrase, but Farah’s book is so short and so elementary that it alone can’t really prepare one for speaking in many different situations. *Somali Common Expressions* may be expensive, but there’s nothing else quite as wide-ranging and useful that also has complete audio.

All of the Dunwoody Press Somali books are great, and though I would recommend getting this one as well, it’s not as essential as *Somali Textbook,* *Somali Reference Grammar,* and *Somali-English Dictionary with English Index*. Those are the crown jewels of the Dunwoody series. *Somali Common Expressions* is great, but you can still find other decent phrasebooks for a lot less money if your budget is tight. (See the other phrasebooks reviewed in this document.)





**Somali Newspaper Reader**

**by Abdullahi A. Issa and John D. Murphy**

**Dunwoody Press**

Reading the news in Somali is an important way for intermediate-level students to practice their comprehension and learn new words. *Somali Newspaper Reader* by Issa and Murphy is an excellent book for learning how to read news articles in Somali since it introduces students to the type of vocabulary and tone that is common in news articles. This isn’t a book for beginners, but for those who are ready to start working with news articles, *Somali Newspaper Reader* from Dunwoody press is pretty much the only place to start. It includes 50 excerpts from Somali-language news articles, accompanying audio CDs of the articles read in Somali, vocabulary lessons, complete English translations, and a Somali-English glossary of terms. The first article excerpts in the book are just a paragraph or two in length, but these get longer as the book goes on. By the end, you’ll be reading full-length news articles.

Like the other Dunwoody Press resources, *Somali Newspaper Reader* is of a very high quality, and its translations are very precise. As soon as you’re ready for this intermediate-level book, it will open the doors to working with many other authentic news sources. The audio is excellent. The reader does not have a typical Somali name, so I assume he isn’t a native speaker, but his pronunciation is so good that he must be some kind of scholar. After finishing *Somali Newspaper Reader*, using and learning from those Somali news sources becomes a lot more straightforward.





**Somali Handbook**

**by Madina Osman &amp; R. David Zorc**

**Dunwoody Press**

Osman and Zorc’s short handbook is good, but it’s probably the least essential of all the Dunwoody Press resources. *Somali Handbook* appears to be designed for foreign aid workers and medics who do not speak Somali but occasionally need to communicate using basic relevant phrases. This book is 84 pages with lists of common phrases and a short dictionary, and it’s the only pocket guide to Somali that can actually fit into a regular-sized pocket.





**A Somali Language Learning Manual**

**by Gleeson, Awad, Rorick, Farah, and Smoker**

**U.S. Peace Corps**

I love using this book. Don’t dismiss *A Somali Language Learning Manual* just because it doesn’t look as stylish as some of the other resources out there. Gleeson et al.’s work sounds from the title like it might be another textbook or grammar guide, but really it is a large collection of the types of phrases you’ll study as a beginner. This isn’t a book of common phrases grouped by topic either-- it starts with the simplest phrases you learn how to say in any other textbook, and then gradually becomes more complicated as it goes on. *A Somali Language Learning Manual* is great because as intuitive as it sounds, there really aren’t a lot of resources like it. There are so many ways to use it, such as for reviewing content, practicing speech, or using it to build up your bank of flashcards.





**English-Somali Phrasebook with Useful Wordlist**

**By Susan D. Somach**

**Center for Applied Linguistics**

In my opinion, Susan Somach’s book is the best of the Somali phrasebooks. Somach’s book has more and better phrases than Awde’s, and it is really easy to find a copy. I’d still recommend getting both books. Each section of Somach’s *English-Somali Phrasebook* deals with a different topic, and it has great phrases and topical vocabulary that can be easily turned into flashcards to help with conversational Somali. Everything you could ask for!





**Somali – Hippocrene Dictionary &amp; Phrasebook**

**by Nicholas Awde**

**Hippocrene Books**

[https://www.hippocrenebooks.com/store/p302/Somali-Dictionary-and-Phrasebook.html](https://www.hippocrenebooks.com/store/p302/Somali-Dictionary-and-Phrasebook.html)

Of the different pocket guides to Somali that you can get in book form, Nicholas Awde’s *Somali* is one of the best. Though size-wise it’s more suited to a bag or purse, it could probably fit into a large rear pants pocket. It starts out with a little bit of the history of Somalia, a very quick summary of Somali grammar, and then about half of this book is a short dictionary of terms. The other half of its 176 pages has lists of common words and phrases, helpfully categorized by topic and situation.





**Teach Yourself Somali: Your Passport to Mastering Somali**

**by Qasim Farah**

**Global Publishers Canada Inc.**

Qasim Farah’s 65-page phrasebook, *Teach Yourself Somali,* doesn’t look like much at first. But the fact that it has free audio makes it potentially worth buying. The content is quite basic and it’s pretty easy to find these types of basic phrases for free on the internet, but with the audio you can listen to the book on the go.





**Somali-English phrasebook for School Use**

**Ali Suleiman**

**HAAN Associates**

This is a short one, but it has lots of great school-related words and phrases that I haven’t seen in other books. Surprisingly, most of the other phrasebooks don’t have substantial sections on school topics, so this book adds some balance.





**Somali for Beginners**

**Abdi A. Arale**

**Independently published**

It’s a slim 50 pages of simple common expressions you can find in other resources and websites. *Somali for Beginners* seems to be available in limited quantities, and only on Amazon. This book doesn’t have any material that you couldn’t find in the Somach’s or Awde’s phrasebooks.





**A Dictionary of Somali Verbs in Everyday Contexts**

**by Liban A. Ahmad**

**AuthorHouse**

Liban Ahmad’s books on Somali are tremendously useful because they attempt to fill gaps in the current literature available to students. *A Dictionary of Somali Verbs in Everyday Contexts* is not a long conventional dictionary aiming to include as many words as possible. It is a brief book which focuses on about 500 verbs, where the aim is providing the greatest depth and nuance in the definitions. Ahmad’s *Dictionary* includes definitions next to each verb, but then explains the different contexts for using the verb, modeling an example sentence for each separate meaning the verb can take. This means that some verbs have four example sentences in their entries. As the verbs in Ahmad’s *Dictionary* are quite common, it is worth studying each one of them, and converting the sentences to flashcards for practice. I haven’t seen any other Somali dictionaries like this one, and it’s refreshing to see the attention to depth, nuance, and example rather than to word count.





**Iftiin's Super Handbook: English - Somali Reference Guide**

**Iftiin Publishers**

Iftiin is a great publisher, and it has many books for Somali speakers learning English. Most of those aren’t helpful for English-speaking students of Somali, but *Iftiin’s Super Handbook* is the rare book that works both ways. It’s extremely helpful, and it contains one of the best phrasebooks available. *Iftiin’s Super Handbook* is three books in one: a phrasebook, an idiom dictionary, and a vocabulary builder. The phrasebook is comparable to the great *English-Somali Phrasebook with Useful Wordlist* by Susan Somach, and it has a much larger section on business and job-related sentences and vocabulary than any other book of its kind. This first section alone makes *Iftiin’s Super Handbook* worth getting.

The middle section, the idiom dictionary, is probably even more helpful than the standalone idiom dictionary by Yusuf Kahin from Scansom Publishers (see my review in my post on Somali dictionaries). Kahin concentrates on explaining much longer English-language idioms and slang expressions, while the Iftiin guide focuses on much shorter expressions that most English speakers use constantly but do not perceive as idioms. Phrases like “catch up”, “by far”, “root out”, and “touch on”. The third section is a very simple English-Somali dictionary. Each entry has an English word, Somali-language definitions, and an example sentence. It’s not bad but it’s no replacement for having a real dictionary. *Iftiin's Super Handbook* can be relatively difficult to find for sale online, but if you check eBay you may be in luck.





**The 2000 Most Frequently Used Somali Nouns**

**By Neri Rook**

**Amazon Kindle Store**

[https://www.amazon.com/2000-Most-Frequently-Somali-Nouns-ebook/dp/B01EMHCFIQ](https://www.amazon.com/2000-Most-Frequently-Somali-Nouns-ebook/dp/B01EMHCFIQ)

Neri Rook has several of these Kindle books for sale, where the author appears to have taken English word lists and run them through Google Translate, and then published the results for Kindle. I am not certain Rook did it that way—I’m just saying that’s how it looks to me. Normally that kind of approach isn’t advisable, but it works for a basic list of nouns. One of the problems with word lists in other Somali resources is that they usually only list nouns in the indefinite form, meaning the student has to spend hours looking up each noun in the dictionary to find its grammatical gender, which is necessary for any type of conjugation. Rook’s noun list is refreshing because all the nouns are listed in their definite forms.





**The 750 Most Frequently Used Somali Adjectives**

**By Neri Rook**

**Amazon Kindle Store**

[https://www.amazon.com/Most-Frequently-Used-Somali-Adjectives-ebook/dp/B01EPL4X2U](https://www.amazon.com/Most-Frequently-Used-Somali-Adjectives-ebook/dp/B01EPL4X2U)

We’re on slightly shakier ground with these translations of adjectives, but most of them are accurate. On the whole, I think this resource is useful if you have already studied Somali long enough to spot some of the more questionable renderings.





**The 1200 Most Frequently Used Somali Verbs**

**By Neri Rook**

**Amazon Kindle Store**

[https://www.amazon.com/1200-Most-Frequently-Somali-Verbs-ebook/dp/B01ETX9ICO](https://www.amazon.com/1200-Most-Frequently-Somali-Verbs-ebook/dp/B01ETX9ICO)

Terrible! Don’t waste your money! Something went terribly wrong in the translation process. Use Liban Ahmad’s *A Dictionary of Somali Verbs in Everyday Context* instead.





**Learn Somali with Word Scramble Puzzles, volume 1**

**By David Solenky**

**Independently published**

This is a short book of vocabulary puzzles where you unscramble the letters of common words and short phrases in Somali. It’s not very deep, but it's a fun way to review basic material.
